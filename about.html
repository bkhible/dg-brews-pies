<div class="content">
    <p>I’m an aspiring web developer with a foundation in HTML and CSS and a strong passion for building thoughtful, practical, and aesthetically-pleasing user experiences. I’m currently expanding my skills through The Odin Project, where I’m deepening my understanding of front-end web development and strengthening my problem-solving abilities through hands-on projects.</p>

<p>My path into tech started long before I knew it could be a career. In 2005-2006, I fell in love with coding while customizing pages on websites like Neopets, Myspace, Xanga, and Tumblr. My curiosity quickly turned into a creative outlet, spending hours tweaking layouts by editing their code and even adding my own graphics designed in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. That early spark has always lingered in my mind throughout my adolescent years into adulthood, and has evolved into a clear professional goal of mine.</p>

<p>For 14+ years, I’ve worked in visual merchandising and retail, where I developed a sharp eye for layout, hierarchy, spacing, and storytelling through design. I’ve led merchandising initiatives, executed brand standards, and created engaging in-store experiences that guide customer behavior and improve usability in physical spaces. This background translates naturally into web design and front-end development. I understand how visual structure influences interaction, how details shape user experience, and how to design with both aesthetics and functionality in mind.</p>

<p>I’m excited to combine my design sensibility, retail and visual merchandising experience, and technical training to build clean, responsive, and user-centered websites.</p>
